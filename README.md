# H1 Project2

Our web application provides a central area for most of what we need to manage the job hunt. It is not a job search tool.

It is a Database for Companies, Contacts, Job Opportunities, Activities
We wanted to take advantage of relational aspect of mySQL:
“Please walk us through your resumé” . . . which resumé?
Better identify and leverage your network
Better organization and efficiency
Support concentrating on the “Top 40” companies of your search
Help us to read fewer job descriptions and have a higher hit rate
Aid your follow through

Questions We Want To Be Able To Answer:
Which prospective employers are most important to me?
Good company
Location
I have contacts there
Who do I know that works at company x?
Who do I know that has a connection at company x?
What open action items do I have?
Which document did I submit as cover letter or resumé for job ‘x’?
How can I streamline the process, especially directly from company sites?
Which sources have produced better results: Indeed, LinkedIn, company sites?
What titles have been successful searches / applications?
